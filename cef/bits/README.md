# Bits

Bits of code meant to be shared by multiple sub-projects and doesn't make much sense to export as PSP library for reuse (e.g. Only one ISO driver is run at a time so it doesn't make sense to export from `systemctrl` as doing so will increase the size of the "systemctrl.prx" and the memory usage even when no iso driver is currently being used).
